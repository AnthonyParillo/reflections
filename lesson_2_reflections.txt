Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: It Initialized and empty Git repository. It is needed so we can initiate a version 
control for our reflections.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

A: Repository is the full "folder" of files in the git repo that was initiated/created. 
The Working Directory is where the repository or current commit that is "checked out" is 
being worked on. Staging Area is a place inbetween like a "limbo" before you "commit" to 
changes to commit/working directory you are making changes to inside the repository. 

The staging area allows you to group files to one commit and also decide if the files
are the correct files before you "commit" to the changing the commit currently being 
worked on.
