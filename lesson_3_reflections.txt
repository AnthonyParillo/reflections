Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: You should probably use a remote repository if you are on a work computer or some other
computer that is not your own.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Pulling manually brings changes into your current local repository almost like a merge.
If Git stayed up-to-date with remote then changes from local not pushed yet would be lost.
