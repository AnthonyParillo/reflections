Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: You should probably use a remote repository if you are on a work computer or some other
computer that is not your own. 

2.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Pulling manually brings changes into your current local repository almost like a merge.
If Git stayed up-to-date with remote then changes from local not pushed yet would be lost.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

A: 

"Forks" pertain to a repository on GitHub that you do not have rights to. Forking allows
anyone to pull a copy of a repository to their GitHub account to modify without repercussions
or hindering the other original repository from the owner. Forks can be used when a person 
wants to collaborate with the open source repository or when they want to modify it to make
a version of their own. 

"Clones" pertain to making a exact current copy of a local or remote repository. Clones
can be used same way as forks, but, instead of the way forks work, they are local or from
a repository you have access to remotely or local. Also, it would be good to use clones to 
make a copy of a repository to either backup or to use for an experiment to keep original 
clean of too many branches or commits. This clone is a completely different/new repository
from the original.

"Branches" pertain to a "side project" or "off-shoot" of a repository local or remote. A branch
is an exact copy of the master repository with new commits that follow only that the new route
or "branch" that is made. It is kept track of through git commits and will not be part of the 
"master" branch until merged. This allows for changes to be experimented with the original "master" branch without breaking the "master" branch. Branches can be used locally to change
certain things in the repository before committing them. Upon merging the master to the new 
branch, the old branch becomes one with the master and continues on. 

In summary, a fork is a clone/branch/copy from a repository on GitHub that is not yours and
is brought to your GitHub as a new repository to be modified. A clone is a exact copy of a
repository that you have on GitHub(remote) or local that can stay on GitHub or brought 
locally then modified but still becomes a new repository where it is stored. A branch is 
a copy of the current repository's branch/commit being worked in that can be modified within 
the repository but does not become a new repository.
